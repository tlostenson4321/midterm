Things that still need to be done.

Need to connect all of front selects.

Breweries already have their location and beers added to them.

Now need to have functions set for when those specific ones are clicked. 

Will probably have to go through each combo of options to get it to work. Whether that be different functions. or if else functions. 

Like: 
	if amber and boulder, go to Avery.
